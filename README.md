# RequirementsSuperTool

An AI-powered software requirements generation platform that helps product owners, business analysts, developers, and stakeholders produce structured, regulation-aware requirements documents. Users answer domain-specific questions, optionally upload a project document, and the system generates functional requirements (FR), non-functional requirements (NFR), use case documents, and full SRS reports using the Anthropic Claude API combined with a domain knowledge base stored in Qdrant.

**Live demo:** [req-tool-five.vercel.app](https://req-tool-five.vercel.app)

# Key Features

- **AI-Driven Generation** — Produces FR and NFR lists tailored to the selected domain, country regulations, user role, and project context.
- **Document Upload** — Accepts PDF and DOCX files (up to 20 MB); extracts and processes text automatically.
- **PII Protection** — Detects and removes personally identifiable information from uploaded content using Microsoft Presidio before any AI processing.
- **Domain Knowledge Base** — Retrieves regulation-specific context from a Qdrant vector database (RAG pipeline) to ground generated requirements in real-world compliance needs.
- **Requirement Refinement** — Users can edit, add, and delete individual requirements after generation; every edit is versioned in a history log.
- **Document Export** — Generates formatted SRS and use case documents downloadable as DOCX.
- **Role-Based Access** — Separate user and admin roles; admins can manage users, domains, and audit logs.
- **Full Audit Trail** — All system actions and login attempts are logged for traceability.

# Architecture

The system is organized into five layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **UI** | Next.js pages, Axios API client, document generator |
| **Routers** | FastAPI HTTP endpoints (auth, domains, requirements, input, admin) |
| **Services** | Business logic — auth, RAG pipeline, AI generation, file processing, auditing |
| **Core** | Infrastructure — JWT, SQLAlchemy ORM, rate limiting, email, Qdrant client |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL (relational data) + Qdrant (vector embeddings) |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed Mermaid diagrams of the system, RAG pipeline, and layered architecture.

# Local Development

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16
- A running Qdrant instance (cloud)

# 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows


# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

# Configure environment variables
copy .env.example .env
# .env file is not published as it contains sensitive data and instead i put .env example of what ot includes

# Apply database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start the development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

- API base URL: `http://localhost:8000`
- Swagger docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
# in the .env.local file set:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

- App URL: `http://localhost:3000`

---

# Docker

```bash
# Copy and populate the backend environment file
copy backend\.env.example backend\.env
# Edit backend/.env with your credentials

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:8000` |
| Swagger docs | `http://localhost:8000/docs` |

Run database migrations inside the running container:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```
